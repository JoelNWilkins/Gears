# Gears

The file gearGenerator.py will create a list of gear points and save them to a csv file named gearData.csv
The gear parameters used to generate the gear will be saved to a csv file named gearParameters.csv

The file gearModel.py is used to create a 3D model of 2 gears interacting and does so by loading data from gearData.csv and gearParameters.csv
